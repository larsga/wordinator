<p>
<run>This element specifies that the contents of this paragraph are at least partly rendered on the same page as the
following paragraph whenever possible.</run>
</p>
<p>
<run>This means that if the contents of the current paragraph would normally be completely rendered on a different
page than the following paragraph (because only one of the two paragraphs would fit on the remaining space on
the first page), then both paragraphs shall be rendered on a single page. This property can be chained between
multiple paragraphs to ensure that all paragraphs are rendered on a single page without any intervening page
boundaries. If this is not possible the entire set of paragraphs that are grouped together using this property
would exceed a single page in any case, then the set of "keep with next" paragraphs shall start on a new page,
with page breaks as needed afterwards.</run>
</p>
<p>
<run>If this element is omitted on a given paragraph, its value is determined by the setting previously set at any level
of the style hierarchy (i.e. that previous setting remains unchanged). If this setting is never specified in the style
hierarchy, then this property shall not be applied.</run>
</p>
<p>
<run>As shown above, the second paragraph and third paragraph are being rendered on two separate pages.
However, a producer can specify that the second paragraph should not be displayed without any part of the
third by setting the keepNext element as follows:</run>

  <run>Paragraph with keeplines set on it. It should be forced to page 2. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the
pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent
of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or
to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to
them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established
should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long
train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is
their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the
patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</run>
