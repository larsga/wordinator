<p>
<run>This element specifies that the contents of this paragraph are at least partly rendered on the same page as the
following paragraph whenever possible.</run>
</p>
<p>
<run>This means that if the contents of the current paragraph would normally be completely rendered on a different
page than the following paragraph (because only one of the two paragraphs would fit on the remaining space on
the first page), then both paragraphs shall be rendered on a single page. This property can be chained between
multiple paragraphs to ensure that all paragraphs are rendered on a single page without any intervening page
boundaries. If this is not possible the entire set of paragraphs that are grouped together using this property
would exceed a single page in any case, then the set of "keep with next" paragraphs shall start on a new page,
with page breaks as needed afterwards.</run>
</p>
<p>
<run>If this element is omitted on a given paragraph, its value is determined by the setting previously set at any level
of the style hierarchy (i.e. that previous setting remains unchanged). If this setting is never specified in the style
hierarchy, then this property shall not be applied.</run>
</p>
<p>
<run>As shown above, the second paragraph and third paragraph are being rendered on two separate pages.
However, a producer can specify that the second paragraph should not be displayed without any part of the
third by setting the keepNext element as follows:</run>

<run>This paragraph follows the keepNext paragraph. When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve
the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
